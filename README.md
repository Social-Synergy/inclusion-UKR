Hello and welcome to the “Inclusion UKR” wiki!

Thank you for your interest in the new Ukrainian Cyrillic font “Inclusion UKR” developed by UNICEF Ukraine in partnership with NGO “Social Synergy”.

“Inclusion UKR” was specifically designed to be convenient for a wide range of users, including those with dyslexia. For reference, Dyslexia is a feature of the brain that causes difficulty in perception and interpretation of printed characters. Latin type fonts have long been developed and used to help mitigate such difficulties, but the need of those, who use Cyrillic script hasn’t been met. Unlike some recent attempts to adapt existing Latin analogues, “Inclusion UKR” is a fundamentally new type font created in Ukraine in close collaboration with scientists and tested for convenience with a substantially large group of children, who have dyslexia and experience difficulties with acquiring reading skills.

The font was designed by the Ukrainian artist, illustrator and type-designer Oleh Petrenko-Zanevsky, well known to young readers and their parents for illustrations in children's books from publishing houses [А-БА-БА-ГА-ЛА-МА-ГА](http://ababahalamaha.com.ua/en), [ВСЛ](https://starylev.com.ua/foreign-rights) and many others. Related research study was coordinated by Romana Ivanus.

Further development of styles and symbols will continue as well as testing for usability by a wider range of readers. The font will also be made available for commercial use by publishers of children's, educational and other literature. Currently, the font is open for non-commercial use the [CC BY-NC-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).
